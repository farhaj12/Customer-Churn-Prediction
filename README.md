# Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will churn (leave a service) using machine learning techniques.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to identify customers who are likely to churn based on their demographic
information, service usage, and billing details.

## Dataset
Telco_Customer_Chu dataset containing 7,043 customers.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score

Random Forest performed better in terms of accuracy and recall.

## Business Impact
This project helps businesses proactively identify at-risk customers
and apply retention strategies to reduce customer loss and revenue decline.
